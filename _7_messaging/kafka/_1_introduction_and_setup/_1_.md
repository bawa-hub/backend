1. Introduction to Kafka
What is Kafka?

Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. It allows you to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time. Kafka is designed for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance, making it suitable for building scalable and reliable data pipelines and streaming applications.
Kafka Use Cases

    Real-time Analytics: Kafka can be used to collect and process data in real time, making it useful for analytics, monitoring, and tracking systems.
    Log Aggregation: Collect logs from multiple services and store them in Kafka for analysis or future processing.
    Data Pipelines: Kafka can serve as a buffer to manage data flows between different applications, systems, or services.
    Stream Processing: Kafka Streams is a library used to process data streams in real time.

Kafka Components Overview

    Producer: A component that sends data (messages) to Kafka topics.
    Consumer: A component that reads messages from Kafka topics.
    Broker: A Kafka server that stores data and handles client requests.
    ZooKeeper: A service that manages and coordinates Kafka brokers. Kafka uses ZooKeeper for distributed consensus and cluster management.
    Topic: A named channel to which producers send messages and consumers read messages.
    Partition: Kafka topics are split into partitions for scalability and parallel processing.

Kafka Architecture

Kafka follows a distributed, horizontally scalable architecture. It consists of producers, consumers, brokers, and Zookeeper. Multiple producers can send data to different partitions of a topic, and multiple consumers can read from those partitions. Kafka brokers work together in a cluster to store and manage data. Kafka also replicates data across brokers for fault tolerance.
